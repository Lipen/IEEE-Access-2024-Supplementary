# IEEE-Access-2024-Supplementary

Supplementary materials for IEEE Access paper "Effective Partitioning Method with Predictable Hardness for CircuitSAT".

## Content

There are multiple folders with various materials:

- `data`:
- `scripts`
- `plots`

The content of each folder is described below.

## `data/`

This directory contains all raw or processed data files.

- `circuits`
- `miters`
- `results`

### `data/circuits/`

This directory contains circuits (e.g. AIGs) of multipliers or sorting algorithms.

### `data/miters/`

This directory contains LEC instances, i.e. miters for two different multipliers or sorting algorithms.

#### Miters for Multipliers

#### Miters for Sorting Algorithms

### `data/results/`

This directory contains the experimental results for different partitioning approaches, and also for sequential solving of LEC instances.

- `chunks` — Partitioning via chunks of inputs
- `intervals` — Partitioning via intervals of inputs
- `cnc` — Cube and Conquer
- `sequential` — Single-threaded SAT solver
